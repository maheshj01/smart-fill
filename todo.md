#### Todo

- [x] Should Only work for inputs (not checkboxes or radio buttons)
- [x] API key should be stored locally and fetched
- [x] Resume should be fetched from local Storage
- [ ] User should be able to save custom responses
- [ ] Reduce API calls to gemini for repeated data
- [ ] Some inputs that are made of divs are not being detected
- [ ] Add support for predefined variables

e.g when user prompts for name, they can use `{{name}}` in the prompt response
e.g prompt: "Useing my {{resume}} help me generate a cover letter for Google for this Job position"

### Make a Simple React

- Users can update their profile
- Use that data to autofill
